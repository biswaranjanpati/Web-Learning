## Understanding __ and -- in CSS
.person { }
.person__head { }
.person--tall { }
Elements are delimited with two (2) underscores (__), and Modifiers are delimited by two (2) hyphens (--).

Here we can see that .person {} is the Block; it is the sole root of a discrete entity. .person__head {} is an Element; it is a smaller part of the .person {} Block. Finally, .person--tall {} is a Modifier; it is a specific variant of the .person {} Block.
